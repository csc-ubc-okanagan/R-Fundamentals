## What can you do with R

Lots of things.

`R` is known for and widely used for **statistical computations**. But really, it\'s a **programming language**, so there is little that you can\'t do with it; you\'re not tied to using its statistical packages. You can do text and data mining and analysis, web scraping, you can write your own program from scratch, and much more.

But `R` is also more than just a programming language and tool for statistical analyses. It\'s a **community of developers and users**. This has several implications.

* First, there is a large support network online. If you Google a question, you will most certainly find a solution.
* Second, a lot of add-ons have been created for R, increasing its functionality and consequently, your ability to do novel things with the program.

In R parlance, these add-ons are called packages.

Today, we\'re going to be working almost exclusively with the base R packages, that is, the suite of tools that comes with a basic install. Base R includes a lot of pre-loaded packages by default. At the end, I\'ll point you to a few resources for additional packages that have the potential to greatly simplify your life in R. And time permitting we\'ll install and load some of these.

Lastly, R has certain features that make it both **very accessible to non programmers** and **very challenging to grapple**. This makes it both relatively low barrier, but on the flip side, it makes it very easy to use it poorly. A few to note:

* Because it\'s community developed, `R` has that support network, so you\'ll almost always get an answer online.
* But, in an effort to provide solutions, `R` has also had multiple syntaxes developed, that is, `R` has more than one correct grammatical structure. So, when you\'ve learned the syntax for base R and you encounter a solution to your problem written in the Tidyverse syntax, things can be confusing.
* R also, as we\'ll see, does some guess work - or coercion - for you when you\'re working with data types, something that can lead to unexpected results.

We\'re going to touch on a number of things that you can do with R, without delving into any in too much detail - the goal here is put you in a place where you are comfortable enough to **engage in further inquiry** and to **ask questions** that will get you helpful answers.

Because you can do so much with R, no single resource will every be able to answer all of your questions. We\'ll also increase the complexity of what we explore with R over the course of the next couple of hours.

### Examples

But let\'s start with a few simple examples. Try typing the following into your console:

```{R}
mean(1:256)
```

What\'s happened?

* You\'ve calculated the arithmetic mean of the numbers 1 to 256.
* This single sequence of numbers is a **vector** and `mean()` is a **function**.

**Let\'s unpack this a bit though.**

We\'ll create a stand alone vector that we can do some descriptive stats on, that is, we\'ll create a column data. We\'ll do this with the concatenate function `c()`; concatenate as in linking things together.

```{R}
c(1:256)
```

The above is just a simple output though, to do something with the data in this vector we need to store the data somehow, so we can retrieve it, not just print it to our console. We\'re going to store it in a **variable** called myFirstVector, and we do that in R with the assignment `<-`

```{R}
myFirstVector <- c(1:256)
```

This time, when you hit enter, nothing happens. But we can now recall our variable

```{R}
myFirstVector
```

Now that we have our vector, we can calculate the mean with the `mean()` function. So, we\'ll pass `myFirstVector` to `mean()`

```{R}
mean(myFirstVector)
```

And there you go. We\'ve created a vector by assigning a series of values to a variable and calculated the mean of these values; that is, we can generate data and calculate descriptive statistics on them.

### But wait, there\'s more

R also allows us to ask questions about our data. 

For example, we can look at just the beginning, or just the end of our vector using the `head()` and `tail()` functions. To do this, we pass our object, in this case `myFirstVector` to each of these functions.

```{R}
head(myFirstVector)

tail(myFirstVector)
```

We can also inquire about the nature of our vector. We can ask, for example, how long it is with the `length()` function

```{R}
length(myFirstVector)
```

We can ask if it is a vector with `is.vector()`

```{R}
is.vector(myFirstVector)
```

We can ask what type of data it contains with `typeof()`

```{R}
typeof(myFirstVector)
```

### So what can you do with R?

You can (among other things)

* generate data and store that data in variables
* run statistical inquiries on that data
* look at your data in a variety of ways
* ask questions about your data

### Exercise 2.1

1. Create a vector called `myNumbers` with 201 values ranging from 100 to 300 *hint* use `c()`
2. Look at the first few and the last few numbers of your new vector *hint* use `head()` and `tail()`
3. Calculate the mean of your vector *hint* use `mean()`

## Getting Help in R

As we mentioned, because you can do so much with R, no single resource will every be able to answer all of your questions. R is also, in part because of this, an ongoing learning experience. So, you will need to know how to get help.

As it happens, there is a fair bit of help built right into R. We can find built in help pages, search for specific terms within these help pages, and search for functions and variables.

### Function help pages

This can be done typing `?functionName` into your console. For example:

```{R, message = FALSE}
?mean
```

or

```{R}
?head
```

The output in RStudio will tell you the function name and the package it\'s included in, for example, the function `mean()` is in the `base` package, and so you\'ll see `mean {base}`. It will also generally provide you with a description, a template for it\'s usage, the arguments that you can pass to it, and some examples of how to use it. All very helpful.

### Searching help pages

While a single `?` searches for the help page on a given function, two `??` does a key word search in the documentation. For example if you\'re interested in plotting some data, you might search for `plot`:

```{R, results=FALSE}
??plot
```

And you\'ll get back a list of vignettes, that is demonstrations of particular packages and their functions, some examples, and help pages that contain your term.

Suppose you want to know if there\'s a function for a particular task, like finding the standard deviation, in your installation of `R`. We can search for the term

```{R, results=FALSE}
??"standard deviation"
```

We can then pull up one of the help pages, say for `stats::sd` and get instructions for using it.

<div class="note">
**Note**

If you did not wrap <code>\"regression model\"</code> in quotations, it would fail to run. We\'ll talk more about using characters in R shortly.
</div>

### Finding variables or functions

The `apropos()` function searches for variables and functions that contain your search term.

```{R, results=FALSE}
apropos("vector")
```

We can also search for functions that start or end with specific sets of characters.

To find variables and functions that start with a particular set of letters, like \'m\' or \'ma\' we prepend the letters with a `^`

```{R, results=FALSE}
apropos("^m")

apropos("^ma")
```

To find variables and functions that end in a particular set of letters, like \'r\' or \'or\' we append the letters with a `$`

```{R, results=FALSE}
apropos("r$")

apropos("or$")
```

### Examples & demos

Many functions and features in R come with examples and demos on how they might be used. We can often get both examples and demos with the `example()` and `demo()` functions.

```{R, results=FALSE, fig.show='hide'}
example(plot) ## Examples using the plot function

demo(graphics) ## Demonstration of the graphics capabilities in R

demo() ## Show a list of all demos available
```

The help built into R can help you explore, discover, and troubleshoot. However, eventually you\'ll need to get into online forums, blogs, and other reading materials to troubleshoot and discover more resources to support your particular area of research.

### Exercise 2.2

1. Find the function built in to R to calculate the median *hint* use `??`
2. Create the following vector stored in a variable called `x` *hint* use `<-` and `c()`
```{r, echo=FALSE}
x <- c(1:20, 50)
x
```
3. By default, `head()` and `tail()` list the first or last 6 data points. Use the help page for the `head()` and `tail()` functions to list the first and last 10 results for a search of all functions or variables that start with the letter `m`.
