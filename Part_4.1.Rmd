## Matrix Data

Vectors are single dimension objects.

Arrays are multidimensional. A matrix is a special case of an array that contains only 2 dimensions; they have length and width but no depth. Think of this like a an excel document that has only one sheet.

* Vectors have one dimension
* Arrays have two or more directions
* Matrices are a type of array that has only 2 dimensions

Right, using our script, let's generate some data to play with.

<div class="note">
**Note**

Generating all of our own data may seem a little tedious, but it's both a great way to troubleshoot, get familiar with a new concept, and once you move into online forums for support, this support will often use ad hoc generated data to provide a solution, so it's good to be familiar with the processes involved in data generation.
</div>

Let's say we're collecting data on people, including their height and weight. To simulate a random sample let's create the following vectors:

```{R}
set.seed(120)

Height <- sample(120:190, 20, replace = TRUE) # A random sample of 20 data points from the range 120 to 190 where values can be replaced

Weight <- sample(50:90, 20, replace = TRUE) # A random sample of 20 data points from the range 50 to 90 where values can be replaced

Height

Weight
```

## Combining Data

We now have two uni-dimensional objects; two vectors.

Let's convert these into a two dimensional array, or matrix by combining them together into a single object that we will call `PhysCharacteristics`, because we're creative that way.

### cbind()

To do this, we will use the function `cbind`, as in column bind; a handy function that allows us to append one vector of data onto another, which will give us a matrix with 2 variables each with 20 data points.

We will give `cbind()` two arguments, the variable names of our two vectors.

```{R}
PhysCharacteristics <- cbind(Height, Weight)

head(PhysCharacteristics)
```

Great, now we have a gird of data.

We could get a summary of our data if we wanted

```{R}
summary(PhysCharacteristics)
```

<div class="note">
**Note**

The length of each variable, that is each vector, in a matrix must be the same length. The above example works well because both `Height` and `Weight` have the same length.

Also, matrices, like vectors, are atomic, that is, an array can only contain one data type - numeric, character, logical etc. We cannot have a matrix where one vector is numeric data and the second is character data. We have other options that we'll look at for this in a moment.
</div>

Let's now create a matrix, with three columns to see a few more things that we can do with matrices and arrays.

Say that we are also interested in collecting age in addition to height and weight. So, as before, let's create a sample of 20 ages from an undergraduate population, so, between 20 and 25:

```{R}
set.seed(120)

Age <- sample(20:25, 20, replace = TRUE) # A random sample of 20 data points from the range 20 to 25 where values can be replaced

Age
```

We're going to employ the function `cbind()` again to join this new variable and associated data with our existing matrix.

```{R}
PhysCharacteristics <- cbind(PhysCharacteristics, Age) 

head(PhysCharacteristics)
```

We now have three columns, one for `Height`, `Weight` and `Age` respectively. And we're finally starting to see something like a proper data set!

### rbind()

In the same way that we can add columns to our data, we can also add rows to our data. We are not limited to adding a single column or a single row at a time.

In the following steps, we will use `rbind()`, as in row bind, to merge two datasets together.

Say we get two datasets of height, weight, and age data, each collected by two different researchers. We already have one set `PhysCharacteristics`. Let's create a second dataset, `ResearcherTwo` to work through this.

As before, we'll take two samples and `cbind` them together.

```{R}
set.seed(121)

Height2 <- sample(120:190, 20, replace = TRUE)

Weight2 <- sample(50:90, 20, replace = TRUE)

Age2 <- sample(20:25, 20, replace = TRUE)

Height2

Weight2

Age2

ResearcherTwo <- cbind(Height2, Weight2, Age2)

head(ResearcherTwo)
```

Now, let's put them together into a new matrix called `completePhysDataSet`.

```{R}
completePhysDataSet <- rbind(PhysCharacteristics, ResearcherTwo)
```

Let's use `View()` to see if we were successful

```{R}
View(completePhysDataSet)
```

We can also get a summary

```{r}
str(completePhysDataSet)
```

## Atomic data

Remember we said that matrices, like vectors, are atomic. Let's see what the implications of this are.

Imagine we were also collecting eye colour as a variable. What we'll do then is create a vector of 40 random samples of eye colour and add it as a fourth column to our matrix, named this time, `physData.eyeColour.sample`.

Remember, we already created a vector of eye colours from which we can generate a random sample.

```{R}
eyeColour
```

Let's use this to generate a sample of 40 data points that we can add to our `completePhysDataSet`

```{R}
set.seed(120)

physData.eyeColour.sample <- sample(eyeColour, 40, replace = TRUE) # A random sample of 40 data points from the character options in the variable eyeColour where values can be replaced

physData.eyeColour.sample
```

Now, we'll add this to `completePhysDataSet` with `cbind()`

```{R}
completePhysDataSet <- cbind(completePhysDataSet, physData.eyeColour.sample)

head(completePhysDataSet)
```

What's happened? R has adapted on the fly to allow you to do this.

Inadvertently, however, it has converted all of your numerical data to character data! Remember we said that R is a little too easy going and let\'s you do things it probably shouldn't? This is one case in point. Instead of providing you with an error or a warning, it has coerced the other data in your matrix to conform to the data type you've added.

You should always be careful and always inquire to see if what you intended to have happen actually happened.

Let's reset things...

```{R}
completePhysDataSet <- rbind(PhysCharacteristics, ResearcherTwo)
```

## Indexing

Matrices, like vectors are indexed, but now they have two axes that are indexed, rows and columns.

We can work with these just as we did with vectors, but we now need to specify if we're interested in a row or a column of data - that is, a variable or an observation.

We do this in the following way: `matrix[row, column]`.

So, say we wanted to see only the `Height` data. We could can do this in one of two ways, with an index number or an index label:

```{R}
completePhysDataSet[, 1]

completePhysDataSet[, "Height"]
```

If we wanted to see `Height` and `Age` only, we can concatenate just as we did with our vector:

```{R}
head(completePhysDataSet[, c(1,3)])

head(completePhysDataSet[, c("Height", "Age")])
```

To see a row:

```{R}
completePhysDataSet[1, ]

completePhysDataSet[1:3, ]
```

<div class="note">
**Note**

By not indicating what row or column we're interested in, R defaults to showing us the entire row or column.
</div>

To see an intersection:

```{R}
completePhysDataSet[1,3]

completePhysDataSet[1, "Age"]

completePhysDataSet[1:3, c("Height", "Age")]
```

## Questions

Three questions that we can ask of multi-dimensional structures in R that can come in handy include.

* `nrow()` which tells us the number of rows
* `ncol()` which tells us the number of columns
* `dim()` which tells us both pieces of information

```{R}
nrow(completePhysDataSet)

ncol(completePhysDataSet)

dim(completePhysDataSet)
```

## What have we learned

* We can store 2 dimensional data in a matrix
* A matrix is atomic, that is, it can only hold one data type
* We can combine vectors to make a matrix with `cbind()`
* We can combine datasets together with `rbind()`
* The vectors of an array need be of the same length

## Exercise 4.1

Let's bring together a few of the things we've learned to organize some of our data. And in doing so, introduce a few more useful functions.

Take a few minutes and try to:

* sort your `Height` vector data from lowest to highest value;
* list only the unique values in this same data;
* list a summary of your data as if it were categorical data;
* sort your summary from above from lowest to highest.

Do the above using the following functions:

* `sort()`
* `unique()`
* `as.factor`
* `summary`
