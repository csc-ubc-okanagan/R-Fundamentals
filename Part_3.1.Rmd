## Data Types

R has 5 basic data types: numeric, complex, logical, character, and raw. Right now, we're going to explore numeric and logical data.

## Numeric and Logical Data

When using R, we are likely going to be analysing data. Understanding how R organizes, classifies, and structures your data is consequently critical to doing this well and avoiding headaches.

### Numeric data

Numeric data in R can be further broken down into two types, integer and double

- double (Double precision floating point, ie can have a decimal)
- integer (Whole number, full stop)

**double** are numbers that can (but don't necessarily) have decimals. That is, they can be real, whole numbers, or decimal.

**Naming variables**

As we go through this workshop, we'll work through concepts through variable assignment and then asking questions about our variables. When naming variables in `R`, keep in mind the following:

* Variable names should first and foremost be meaningful.
* They **cannot** start with a number or a dot followed by a number.
* They **cannot** contain spaces.
* They **can** contain letters, numbers, dots, and underscores.
* Some words are *reserved* and cannot be used, such as *if* and *for*.

More details can be found with `?make.names`
</div>

Let's assign a decimal and whole number to two respective variables:

```{R}
decimalPoint <- 10.1

decimalPoint

noDecimalPoint <- 10

noDecimalPoint
```

We can then inquire about these data with `type(of)`:

```{R}
typeof(decimalPoint)

typeof(noDecimalPoint)
```

And we see that they are both returned as "double". Curious. What if we want an integer? To designate that we want an integer - a whole number - we append the digits with an `L`

```{R}
wholeNumber <- 10L

wholeNumber
```

Now, if we ask about the data type, we are returned "integer":

```{R}
typeof(wholeNumber)
```

<div class="note">
**Note**

Without the `L`, R will create `wholeNumber` as a `double`, as we saw in `noDecimalPoint`

R will convert on the fly between integers and doubles - so, if we're performing a calculation that should only result in a whole number, we need to be keenly aware of this and account for it! We'll look at ways to ensure this in a bit.

### Logical Values

We can also create logical data, that is, data that is either True or False. We could, for example, record the flipping of a coin as either heads or tails, or we could measure it as the number of times we get heads, by declaring a value of heads to be true and a value of tails to be false.

We'll assign two logical statements to a vector and assign it to a variable:

```{R}
logicalVector <- c(TRUE,FALSE)

logicalVector
```

And then we can ask about it - as we'll see in a bit, it's always a good idea to investigate your data and to ask questions about it to ensure that the program that you're working with is behaving as you expect it to!

```{R}
typeof(logicalVector)
```

## Classes

In addition to using `typeof()` for inquiring about data types, we can also use `class()` to get a bit more information about an R object. Occasionally, the output of `typeof()` and `class()` are the same. The details of this should be reserved for a computer science class, but you can get a bit more information from `?class`.

It can useful to think of the `class` as describing what an R object is and `typeof` telling us about the data it contains. As an analogy, we might have a book of poetry. Our object - our book - might have a class of `book` or `text` and if we inquired about the contents with `typeof` we'd get back `poetry`, or something like that.

Just as we can store various types of text in various types of books, notepads etc - R can store various types data in various types of objects. The class of these objects will help us to understand how we can work with our data.

### Vectors

A vector in R is one such object for storing data.

Vectors in R are `atomic`. That is, they can only contain one data type, whether that be numeric, logical, character etc. When we made `myFristVector` we created a container that has specific rules pertaining to the data in that container, namely, it's flat and unidirectional - think of it as being a single row or a single column - and all the data must be of the same type. In fact, we can see this with the `View()` function

```{R}
View(myFirstVector)
```

And we should remember that a vector made up of:

* integer data will be an integer vector
* logical values will be a logical vector
* character values will be a character vector

## Exercise 3.1

* Create three variables that hold one numerical value each:
  * one integer
  * one double, real, number
  * one double, decimal, number
* Inquire as to the type of data and class of object that R tells you each of your variables are. Also ask R to tell you the length of your variables.
  * What do you notice?
  * Do we get a valid response to the class function? If yes, why might this be? A variable with one data point is simply a vector of 1 unit.

## What Have We Learned

* R has 5 basic data types
* R objects may have a class that describe that object
* numeric data can be either integer or double precision floating point (decimal ready), and R will convert between integer and floating point when needed, which isn't always desired!
