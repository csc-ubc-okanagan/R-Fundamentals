## Part 2

### Exercise 2.1

1. Create a vector called `myNumbers` with 201 values ranging from 100 to 300 *hint* use `c()`

```{R}
myNumbers <- c(100:300)
myNumbers
```

2. Look at the first few and the last few numbers of your new vector *hint* use `head()` and `tail()`.

```{R}
head(myNumbers)

tail(myNumbers)
```

3. Calculate the mean of your vector *hint* use `mean()`

```{R}
mean(myNumbers)
```

### Exercise 2.2

1. Find the function to calculate standard deviation and median *hint* use `??`

2. Create a variable called `m_func_var` that stores all the functions and variables on your system that start with the letter `m`.

```{R}
m_func_var <- apropos("^m")

m_func_var
```

3. By default, `head()` and `tail()` list the first or last 6 data points of whatever is passed to them. Use the help page for `head()` and `tail()` to list the first and last 10 results of `m_func_var`.

```{R}
head(m_func_var, n=10)

tail(m_func_var, n=10)
```

4. Calculate the standard deviation and median of your vector *hint* use `sd()` and `median()`

```{R}
sd(x)

median(x)
```

## Part 3

### Exercise 3.1

Find all the `as.` functions available in R. Note that a `.` is a special character in a regular expression search, so to search for the `.` we need to comment it out to override it's \'specialness\'. We do so with a `\`. However, `\` is also a special character, so we need to comment it out too, with an additional `\`.

```{R}
apropos("^as\\.")
```

### Exercise 3.3

1. How many of the values in `dailyHighs` are higher than 27:

```{R}
length(dailyHighs[dailyHighs > 27])
```

2. Get a summary, similar to this, of the data in `Temperature`.

*Note* your values will be different, but the descriptive categories should be the same.

```{R}
summary(dailyHighs)
```

### Exercise 3.4

Replace the temperatures in `Temperature` that are above 27, but this time, replace them with values that are double their own, so if you have 30, it becomes 60, 32, 64 and so on.

```{R}
dailyHighsMultiplied <- replace(dailyHighs, dailyHighs > 27, dailyHighs[dailyHighs > 27] * 2) ## Vector, condition, values where this condition is true * n

dailyHighsMultiplied
```

## Part 4

### Exercise 4.1

Take a few minutes and try to:

* sort your `Height` vector data from lowest to highest value;
* list only the unique values in this same data;
* list a summary of your data as if it were categorical data;
* sort your summary from above from lowest to highest.

Do the above using the following functions:

* `sort()`
* `unique()`
* `as.factor`
* `summary`

```{R}
sort(Height)

sort(unique(Height))

sort(summary(as.factor(Height)))
```

Sort our matrix, by Height and then by Weight. Do this using the function `order()`

<div class="note">
**Note**

`sort()` rearranges a vector in ascending or descending order while `order()` organizes a multi-dimensional object based on individual vectors.
</div>

```{R}
completePhysDataSet[ order(completePhysDataSet[, "Height"], completePhysDataSet[, "Weight"]), ]
```
